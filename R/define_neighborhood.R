#' Calculate neighborhood relations
#'
#' Calculates neighborhood relations for the MOEADr package
#'
#' This routine calculates the neighborhood relations for the MOEA/D.
#'
#' **Warning**: this routine may access (but not directly modify) variables
#' from the calling environment.
#'
#' @param neighbors List containing the decomposition method parameters.
#'  This list must contain the following key-value pairs:
#' \itemize{
#'   \item `neighbors$name`, type of neighborhood to use. The following types
#'         are currently available:
#'         \itemize{
#'           \item `neighbors$name = "lambda"`: defines the neighborhood using
#'             the distance matrix for the weight vectors. The calculation is
#'             performed only once for the entire run.
#'           \item `neighbors$name = "x"`: defines the neighborhood using
#'             the distance matrix for the incumbent solution associated with
#'             each subproblem. In this case the calculation is performed at
#'             each iteration.
#' }
#'   \item `neighbors$T`: Neighborhood size. The value of `neighbors$T`
#'          must be smaller than the number of subproblems.
#'   \item `neighbors$delta.p`: Probability of sampling from the neighborhood
#'   when performing variation. Must be a scalar value between 0 and 1.
#' }
#' @param v.matrix matrix of vectors to be used for defining the neighborhoods.
#' @param iter iteration counter of the MOEA/D
#'
#' @return List containing the matrix of selection probabilities (`P`) and
#' the matrix of neighborhoods (`B`).
